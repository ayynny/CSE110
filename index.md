I am a 3rd year computer science major at _UCSD_! Raised in the heart of tech - Silicon Valley, now in
San Diego chasing my dreams of making big bucks as a software engineer! I have been
coding since high school, and taking my skills further to work together with fellow SWE
to make a positive impact on the world! Interested in computer vision and AI.
